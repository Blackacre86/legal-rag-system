🎯 Mission
Massachusetts law enforcement officers need instant access to accurate legal information during critical moments. This RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system transforms the comprehensive Scheft 2025 Criminal Law manual into an intelligent Q&A system, providing officers with:

⚡ Instant answers to complex legal questions
📍 Precise citations from the official manual
🎯 Context-aware responses using GPT-4
💰 Cost-efficient embeddings (8x cheaper than traditional models)
🔒 Secure, local deployment for sensitive law enforcement data

Key Components

📄 PDF Processing: PyMuPDF extracts text from 700MB manual
🔪 Smart Chunking: 1,000 char chunks with 200 char overlap
🧹 Text Cleaning: Removes page numbers, headers, OCR artifacts
🎯 Embeddings: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small (512 dimensions)
💾 Vector Store: Chroma DB for persistent, queryable storage
🧠 Answer Generation: GPT-4 synthesizes coherent responses


📚 Usage Examples
Basic Question-Answering
pythonfrom rag_with_chroma import MassLawRAG

# Initialize the system
rag = MassLawRAG()

# Ask a question
result = rag.answer_question("What constitutes probable cause for an arrest?")

print(result['answer'])
# Output: "Probable cause for an arrest exists when facts and circumstances 
# within the officer's knowledge are sufficient to warrant a prudent person's
# belief that the suspect has committed or is committing a crime..."
Search for Specific Topics
python# Search for relevant chunks without GPT-4 processing
results = rag.search("Miranda rights", n_results=5)

for doc in results['documents'][0]:
    print(doc[:200] + "...")
Interactive Mode
bash$ python rag_with_chroma.py

Police can search a vehicle without a warrant in several circumstances under 
Massachusetts law:

1. **Consent**: If the driver voluntarily consents to the search
2. **Probable Cause** (Motor Vehicle Exception): If there's probable cause...

🔧 Configuration
Environment Variables
Create a .env file:

# Optional
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
